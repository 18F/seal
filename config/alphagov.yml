    - Don’t be a silo of knowledge
    - Ask if anyone needs support before picking up new work
    - Be considerate to remote workers
    - Avoid gendered language when it isn’t needed
    - Turn up to meetings on time, one person speaks at a time
    - Developers - we prefer to pair when it’s suitable, no cherry picking from the backlog
    - Any excuse for cake - or generally celebrating awesomeness
    - Never be afraid to suggest better ways of working.
    - Stories should start with a user need
    - It’s not done until it’s in the hands of the people who need it
    - When working at home, dial in to stand-up
    - Keep things up-to-date - like the digital wall, team calendar
    - Communicate what you’re working on - make sure you don’t leave people out of the loop
    - Meetings must have a clear purpose and make the best use of everyone’s time
    - Keep our desks and work spaces (including the tea stand) tidy
